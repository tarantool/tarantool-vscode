---Search for a tuple via the given index.
---
---**Possible errors:**
---
---* `index_object` does not exist.
---* Wrong type.
---* More than one tuple matches.
---
---**Complexity factors:**
---
---* Index size.
---* Index type.
---
---The `box.space...select` function returns a set of tuples as a Lua table; the `box.space...get` function returns at most a single tuple.
---And it is possible to get the first tuple in a space by appending `[1]`. Therefore `box.space.tester:get{1}` has the same effect as `box.space.tester:select{1}[1]`, if exactly one tuple is found.
---
---**Example:**
---
--- ```
--- ```tarantoolsession
--- tarantool> box.space.tester.index.primary:get(2)
--- ---
--- - [2, 'Music']
--- ...
--- ```
---
---@param key box.tuple<T, U>|tuple_type[]|scalar
---@return box.tuple<T, U>? tuple the tuple whose index key matches key, or nil.
function index_methods:get(key) end

---Search for a tuple or a set of tuples by the current index.
---
---To search by the primary index in the specified space, use the [`box.space.select`](lua://box.space.select) method.
---
---**Note:** this method doesn't yield. For details, [Cooperative multitasking](doc://app-cooperative_multitasking).
---
---**Note:** the `after` and `fetch_pos` options are supported for the `TREE` :ref:`index <index-types>` only.
---
---This function might return one or two values:
---* The tuples whose fields are equal to the fields of the passed key. If the number of passed fields is less than the number of fields in the current key, then only the passed fields are compared, so `select{1,2}` matches a tuple whose primary key is `{1,2,3}`.
---* (Optionally) If `options.fetch_pos` is set to `true`, returns a base64-encoded string representing the position of the last selected tuple as the second value.
---
---If no tuples are fetched, returns `nil`.
---
---**Warning:**
---
---Use the `offset` option carefully when scanning large data sets as it linearly increases the number of scanned tuples and leads to a full space scan. Instead, you can use the `after` and `fetch_pos` options.
---
---**Examples:**

---
---**Note:**
---
---`box.space.{space-name}.index.{index-name}:select(...)[1]` can be replaced with `box.space.{space-name}.index.{index-name}:get(...)`.
---
---That is, `get` can be used as a convenient shorthand to get the first tuple in the tuple set that would be returned by `select`.
---
---However, if there is more than one tuple in the tuple set, then `get` throws an error.

---Search for a tuple or a set of tuples via the given index, and allow iterating over one tuple at a time.
---
---To search by the primary index in the specified space, use the [`box.space.pairs`](lua://box.space.pairs) method.
---
---The `{key}` parameter specifies what must match within the index.
---
---**Note:** `{key}` is only used to find the first match. Do not assume all matched tuples will contain the key.
---
---The `{iterator}` parameter specifies the rule for matching and ordering. Different index types support different iterators. For example, a TREE index maintains a strict order of keys and can return all tuples in ascending or descending order, starting from the specified key. Other index types, however, do not support ordering.
---
---To understand consistency of tuples returned by an iterator, it's essential to know the principles of the Tarantool transaction processing subsystem. An iterator in Tarantool does not own a consistent read view.
---
---Instead, each procedure is granted exclusive access to all tuples and spaces until there is a "context switch": which may happen due to [the implicit yield rules](doc://app-implicit-yields), or by an explicit call to [`fiber.yield`](lua://fiber-yield).
---
---When the execution flow returns to the yielded procedure, the data set could have changed significantly. Iteration, resumed after a yield point, does not preserve the read view, but continues with the new content of the database. The tutorial [indexed pattern search](doc://c_lua_tutorial-indexed_pattern_search) shows one way that iterators and yields can be used together.
---
---For information about iterators' internal structures, see the ["Lua Functional library"](https://luafun.github.io/index.html) documentation.

---Update a tuple.
---
---The update function supports operations on fields — assignment, arithmetic (if the field is numeric), cutting and pasting fragments of a field, deleting or inserting a field.
---Multiple operations can be combined in a single update request, and in this case they are performed atomically and sequentially.
---Each operation requires specification of a field identifier, which is usually a number.
---When multiple operations are present, the field number for each operation is assumed to be relative to the most recent state of the tuple, that is, as if all previous operations in a multi-operation update have already been applied.
---In other words, it is always safe to merge multiple update invocations into a single invocation, with no change in semantics.
---@param key box.tuple<T,U> | tuple_type[] | scalar

---
---**Complexity factors:**

---
---**Examples:**
---
--- ```lua
--- -- Find the maximum value in the specified index
--- max = box.space.bands.index.year:max()
--- --[[
--- ---
--- - [8, 'Nirvana', 1987]

---Iterate over an index, counting the number of tuples which match the key-value.
---
---Return the number of tuples. If compared with `len()`, this method works slower because `count()` scans the entire space to `count` the tuples.
---
---**Example:**
---
--- ```lua
--- -- Count the number of tuples that match the full key value
--- count = box.space.bands.index.year:count(1965)
--- --[[
--- ---
--- - 3
--- ...
--- --]]
---
--- -- Count the number of tuples that match the partial key value
--- count_partial = box.space.bands.index.year_band:count(1965)
--- --[[
--- ---
--- - 3
--- ...
--- --]]
--- ```
---@param key? box.tuple<T, U> | tuple_type[] | scalar
---@param iterator? box.iterator
---@return integer number_of_tuples
function index_methods:count(key, iterator) end

---Return the total number of bytes taken by the index.
---
---@return integer
function index_methods:bsize() end

---Delete a tuple identified by a key.
---
---Same as [`box.space...delete()`](box.space.delete), but key is searched in this index instead of in the primary-key index.
---
---This index ought to be unique.
---
---**Note regarding storage engine:** vinyl will return `nil`, rather than the deleted tuple.
---
---@param key box.tuple<T, U> | tuple_type[] | scalar
---@return box.tuple<T, U>? tuple the deleted tuple
function index_methods:delete(key) end

---Alter an index.
---
---It is legal in some circumstances to change one or more of the index characteristics, for example its type, its sequence options, its parts, and whether it is unique.
---
---Usually this causes rebuilding of the space, except for the simple case where a part’s is_nullable flag is changed from false to true.
---
---@param opts box.index_options
function index_methods:alter(opts) end

---Return a tuple's position for an index.
---
---This value can be passed to the `after` option of the `select` and `pairs` methods:
---* [`index_object:select`](lua://box.index.select) and [`space_object:select`](lua://box.space.select)
---* [`index_object:pairs`](lua://box.index.pairs) and [`space_object:pairs`](lua://box.space.pairs)
---
---**Note:** `tuple_pos` does not work with [functional](box.space.index.func) and multikey indexes.
---
---**Example:**
---
--- ```tarantoolsession
--- -- Insert test data --
--- tarantool> bands:insert{1, 'Roxette', 1986}

## Usage

That's how you use this extension.

* Install the extension from the VS Code marketplace.
* Open a Tarantool project in VS Code.
* Run `Tarantool: Initialize VS Code extension in existing app` command from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).

You may statically type your Lua functions as follows.

```lua
---@class user_info
---@field name string User's name.
---@field age? number User's age (optional).

---@alias user_tuple [string, number]

---@param tuples user_tuple[]
---@return user_info[]
local function deflatten_users(tuples)
    -- ...
end

---@type user_info
local unnamed_user = { name = 'Unnamed' }
```

For more examples, refer to [the examples folder](examples/) with tutorials on how to type your Lua code.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues on feature requests, wrong type annotations and bugs. If you're dealing with a problem related to LSP we'd appreciate addressing a direct issue to [the used external Lua Language server](https://github.com/CppCXY/emmylua-analyzer-rust).

We also appreciate contributions via pull requests.

Thank you for your interest in Tarantool and its development tools!

## References & acknowledgments

This is an extension for the [Tarantool database](https://www.tarantool.io/). It uses [VS Code EmmyLua extension](https://github.com/EmmyLua/VSCode-EmmyLua) with [emmylua-analyzer-rust](https://github.com/CppCXY/emmylua-analyzer-rust) under the hood and [RedHat YAML extension](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml) dependencies as providers of Lua and YAML language servers and extend them with Tarantool-specific annotations.

A lot of the initial work has been done by Tarantool community in the [original Tarantool VS Code annotations](https://github.com/vaintrub/vscode-tarantool).
